          <h1>Listen: A Museum Exhibition Proposal</h1>
          
          <div class="summary">
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p><em>Listen</em>, analyzes and calls to action centered around music creation, consumption, and communication, specifically for those who are unheard or marginalized in today's music sphere. The exhibition aims to transform visitors' perceptions of popularized music and traditional forms of audio while deepening their understanding of digital music history and its integral role in culture and society – especially in museums.</p>
            
            <p>The exhibition features three exhibits, or "records," available in augmented digital form for those physically unable to attend:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>"Record One"</strong> introduces music's impact on the individual – visitors reflect on their personal music experiences and song collections.</li>
              <li><strong>"Record Two"</strong> focuses on the collective, highlighting music's diversity and unique position in museums as cultural connectivity.</li>
              <li><strong>"Record Three"</strong> includes a call to action aimed at museums, governments, and educational institutions to promote inclusive music communication.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Combined, these sections provide a holistic reimagination of how music can integrate into museums in our digitally interconnected world. Music is, after all, "the universal language of mankind," entrenched in all cultures and an extension of both individual and collective history. The exhibit ultimately gives listeners an unforgettable experience with music, one they can share or listen to on repeat for visits to come.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="context">
            <h2>Context and Rationale</h2>
            
            <h3>Music and Museum Experience</h3>
            <p>Life and daily interaction are transitioning to digital formats more than ever. Not surprisingly, both museums and music have undergone similar transformations. Today, music is heavily consumed via digital platforms – companies like Spotify, Apple, and YouTube have changed how people create, share, and collect music. Museums, particularly those focused on music, have been slower to adjust to this digital migration. Consequently, many individuals and underrepresented communities face difficulties accessing museums and relating to music history.</p>
            
            <h3>The Individual</h3>
            <p>The connection between music and museums lies in their origin, both literally and figuratively. According to Eric Partridge's <em>Origins</em>, the words "museum" and "music" stem from the Greek Muses – goddesses of literature, sciences, and the arts. Fittingly, both museums and music relate to the inspiration of individual creativity, or muse.</p>
            
            <p>Our understanding of music depends on its context and our knowledge of its history. Philosopher Lydia Goehr argues the way we view music is highly variable, stating "...not all music falls under a given range of concepts in the same way, and how we think about different sorts of music is deeply historicized." In other words, our musical preferences and perception are influenced by experience and context.</p>
            
            <p>Both museums and music are extremely concentrated spaces in terms of objects and works. However, music transcends materiality, making it a powerful tool for expressing human individuality. Researcher Anja Nylund Hagen identifies "mass customization" in music resulting from innovations such as LPs, CDs, and MP3 files. Unlike Walter Benjamin's emphasis on ordering, owning, and desiring objects and Jean Baudrillard's theory of collecting for personal control, music surrenders its physicality. With digital music, people can categorize music, organize playlists, and share them in online social spheres.</p>
            
            <p>Hagen continues, "The concept of curation is a constructive model and metaphor offering a solution to the issue of information overload online." This exhibition follows the methods of music curation – for the museum to connect deeply with the viewer, it surrenders its exhibit arrangement to that individual. Ultimately, visitors have the power to curate and share their own version of this exhibition, quelling information overloads within museums and music while promoting the exhibition itself.</p>
            
            <h3>The Collective</h3>
            <p>This exhibition isn't the first about music, but it promotes a freer and more accessible viewing experience than others. Towards the end of the 18th century, many private collections of visual art and music became nationalized – like the British Museum in 1759 – and opened to public viewing. However, some musicians were insulted by the way museums "captured" their music. Goehr mentions how musician Heinrich Neuhaus felt most people listened to his music solely because of its place in the museum. Instead, "Neuhaus wanted 'people to come upon his sound accidentally and respond to them without preconceived ideas or expectations.'"</p>
            
            <p>There is no right way to capture or display music itself. Goehr concludes that an "imaginary museum" for music is subsequently one of the best ways to present it. Therefore, this exhibit provides both a physical and intangible version of music in the museum space – physical in its layout, and intangible in its ability to be digitally re-arranged by listeners.</p>
            
            <p>Western music has primarily dominated the literature regarding museum-music; therefore, it's important to recontextualize much of the current musicscape. For example, historian J. Peter Burkholder notes that early composers of mainstream music were pressured to write music for a museum, "for that is what the concert hall has become." However, concert halls – used heavily in western music – are not the only spaces for music. This exhibition will help contribute to an equitable representation of different genres and cultures, reflecting the diverse music trends modeled using visitors' song submissions.</p>
            
            <p>We cannot forget about music outside of the mainstream, such as background music, educational music, religious music, and more. This exhibit reminds all audiences to listen, because regardless of musical talent, training, or knowledge, there is always something new and valuable to be heard.</p>
            
            <p>Another shortcoming in both the museum and music space is accessibility for those with disabilities. While accessibility within museums has recently improved, visitors with disabilities still face challenges, especially with social comfort barriers and stigmas when interacting with exhibits. In an Israeli study on museum accessibility, Yaniv Poria found non-physical elements of museum environments – like interactions with other visitors and worker attitudes – contributed to negative museum experiences.</p>
            
            <p>Not only should museums provide basic accessibility services, but they should also aim to create positive social atmospheres for those with disabilities and those who are neurodivergent. In this sense, music is powerful. People with disabilities use music to stimulate learning (a large part of museum experiences), focus, relax, energize, and connect or interact with those around them regardless of ability or background. An exhibition utilizing both music and social media connectivity will help contribute to greater inclusion of those with disabilities in the museum space.</p>
            
            <h3>Call To Action</h3>
            <p>This experience is for visitors who enjoy music and want to share their musicality with others, especially for non-western listeners and listeners with disabilities. However, the exhibition doubles as a call to action for viewers to shake up music and museum institutions to generate more inclusive listening practices.</p>
            
            <p>Digital streaming companies also play an important role in the marketing and distribution of representation within the industry. Thus, the exhibition encourages companies to focus on increasing digital accessibility and inclusion through their own userbases. Social media, for example, can help alleviate discrepancies within the museum space for those with disabilities as online social engagement has shown to improve their experiences with exhibitions.</p>
            
            <p>We also hope to disrupt research and literature circles within musicology and museology, urging universities to equitably advocate for those from underrepresented communities and accessibility groups. Furthermore, music is a dynamic form of art, everchanging, and it is important to embrace its inherent sense of diversity.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>"Music exists only in the moment of its performance, for if one were ever so skillful in reading notes and had ever so lively an imagination, it cannot be denied that it is only in an unreal sense that music exists when it is read. It really exists only in being produced. This might seem to be an imperfection in this art as compared with others whose productions remain… Yet this is not so. It is rather a proof of the fact that music is higher, a more spiritual art."</p>
              <footer>—Søren Kierkegaard</footer>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>While music is indeed the "universal language of mankind," this exhibition demonstrates how to learn and practice that language positively through individual reflection, collective awareness, and action. Yet still, the exhibition is not meant to contain music and musical objects. Instead, it is meant to elevate music and its role within museums, showing how easy it is to connect with others if, in every fleeting moment, we simply listen a little more.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="exhibition-intro">
            <h2>Introduction to the Exhibition</h2>
            <p>Take a minute and reflect on the noise in your life. Is it loud? Is it busy? Is it complicated? Whatever it is, try your best to brush it aside for now. Whether you like it or not, and whether you notice its presence, music surrounds us all. Today's exhibition aims to re-introduce you to music and its important role in museums and its function as a museum itself.</p>
            
            <p>Three records await you:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>During <strong>Record One</strong> you will learn more about how to navigate the world of sound and noise in your personal life.</li>
              <li><strong>Record Two</strong> will help you develop a better understanding of the important relationship between music and museums as well as our collective understanding of music history and its future.</li>
              <li><strong>Record Three</strong> is meant to challenge you. Whether in museums, universities, online forums, or other communal spaces, it is crucial that all individuals have a voice and have equitable accessibility. Here, we encourage you to make noise. Through social media outreach, digital communication networks, and feedback forums, we hope you start sharing your stories with others.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>As with a digital playlist, you have the authority to change your experience in this exhibition. Using the personal curation feature provided, you can use a mobile device to shuffle, rearrange, or repeat parts of the exhibition as you wish. Feel free to generate new orders through which to explore the gallery and share them with your friends, your family, and even strangers.</p>
            
            <p>Now relax, take a deep breath, and enjoy your time here. Remember, there is no right or wrong way for you to explore this exhibition. All you have to do is <em>Listen</em>.</p>

            <h2>Exhibition Highlights</h2>
            
            <h3>"Record One"</h3>
            <div class="exhibition-item">
              <h4>Orfield Laboratories' Anechoic Chamber (1970)</h4>
              <p><em>Listen</em>. No, really, listen. What do you hear? You are now in the quietest man-made place on earth. First established in 1970 by Steven J. Orfield, this room has served many purposes, ranging from a development and research facility to the recording studio for songs like "Funkytown," by Lipps Inc. As you bathe in the silence, try to reflect on what you are hearing. Perhaps it's the sound of your own thoughts. Some say they can hear the sound of their own blood rushing. Take some time to think, or don't think at all. This is the sound of silence.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="exhibition-item">
              <h4>Sony Walkman Commercial (1981)</h4>
              <p>Before your smartphone streaming services and wireless ear buds there was the Sony Walkman. Forged in the late 1970s and first sold in 1979, the Sony Walkman brought color to a fading generation of music technology. It paved the way for portable music playability and personal audio consumption. Think this little device is ancient? Take a look around the room and learn about other music technologies of the distant past.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>"Record Two"</h3>
            <div class="exhibition-item">
              <h4>The Kellycaster (2019)</h4>
              <p>What may look like a broken guitar is actually a breakthrough technology for one punk-head with a love for music. This transformed guitar reflects John Kelly's determination to turn his struggles into an instrument of passion. The pickup sends the signal from the strings to a Bela Board for real-time keyboard mapping. Kelly's Kellycaster is just one of many examples of how music can make major ripples in the lives of those around us.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="exhibition-item">
              <h4>iTunes Visualizer (2023)</h4>
              <p>Music is not just heard. It is felt, understood, and even seen in different ways. This seemingly random animation uses music information retrieval practices to translate sound wave data to a visual representation of the audio. It has remained a hidden iTunes feature since the platform's introduction on Apple computers but can be used by those with hearing impairments and those without to connect with music. While this technology is special, there is much work to do to expand and enhance the ways we "listen" to music.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>"Record Three"</h3>
            <div class="exhibition-item">
              <h4>Bela Board (2016)</h4>
              <p>Born in the Augmented Instruments Laboratory in the Centre for Digital Music at Queen Mary University of London, the Bela Board revolutionized the way music development and audio research is conducted. The embedded computing platform has allowed for the creation of highly responsive interactive projects, many with musical instruments like the Kellycaster in the other room. Come visit our research workshop and see what ideas you can come up with to help advance research in music technology.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="exhibition-item">
              <h4>McDonald's China: 美好时光 美味共享 (1996)</h4>
              <p>Music is not just beats, rhythms, and melodies. It is alive and all around us. We hear jingles at the station or on TV, on the busy street, and in our footsteps. This is the first commercial for McDonald's in China, featuring a beautiful, emotional song embracing connection with others through food. The song reminds us to realize that, even around the globe, we are all connected through music and that it can find a special home deep within our memories if we let it.</p>
            </div>

          <div class="exhibition-design">
            <h2>Exhibition Design</h2>
            <p>This exhibition offers a unique, customizable experience for all visitors. The layout consists of six interconnected rooms, each housing one of the main objects. Using our digital curation feature, visitors can create their own "playlist" of the exhibition, choosing which rooms to visit and in what order.</p>
            
            <p>Accessibility is central to our design philosophy. The exhibition will be fully accessible digitally through virtual tours and audio walkthroughs for those unable to attend in person. All exhibits include multiple formats for information delivery: written text (including braille), audio descriptions, visual representations, and digital interfaces in multiple languages.</p>
            
            <p>Connecting all rooms is a network of hallways filled with screens displaying digital music codes submitted by visitors. Scan these codes with your device to discover new music and connect with other visitors' musical journeys.</p>
            
            <p>There is no right or wrong way to experience this exhibition. We encourage visitors to explore, customize, and share their unique pathways through the space, just as they would create and share a personal playlist. The exhibition continues to live beyond your visit through digital sharing and ongoing engagement.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Final Note</h2>
            <p>While music is indeed the "universal language of mankind," this exhibition demonstrates how to learn and practice that language positively through individual reflection, collective awareness, and action. The exhibition is not meant to contain music and musical objects, but to elevate music and its role within museums, showing how easily we can connect with others if, in every fleeting moment, we simply listen a little more.</p>
            
            <p>Whether you visit once or return many times, whether you follow our suggested path or create your own, we hope this exhibition inspires you to listen more deeply to the music around you and to find new ways to share your musical experiences with others.</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="visitor-experience">
            <h2>Visitor Experience</h2>
            <p>Upon arriving at the exhibition, visitors will be encouraged to use their mobile devices and personal headphones (or provided audio devices) to create and submit a curated playlist of songs that will serve as a guiding narrative throughout their experience. These songs will play between each of the six main works, which all have audio and subtitle descriptions.</p>
            
            <p>While there is a default order presented to visitors, viewing order is entirely customizable. In fact, we encourage you to play around with the order of the exhibit descriptions and songs as this will only uncover new and more unique ways of experiencing music in the museum.</p>

            <p>While the experience technically ends when the visitors' playlists are through, they are encouraged to share their playlists with others and visit the museum again and again, whether virtually or in-person. Hopefully, the museum exhibition and its influence continues to live just as music does, transcending tradition while getting people to listen.</p>
